Just recently I stumbled over the Linux Foundation's [LFX Training Portal](https://lfx.linuxfoundation.org/tools/training-portal).
It provides lots of interesting training and certification programs with some even being available for free.

I now just finished 'A Beginner's Guide to Linux Kernel Development (LFD103)':

Earners of the LFD103: A Beginner's Guide to Linux Kernel Development badge understand the basics of the Linux kernel development
process and can configure the development system. They understand the basics of git, as well as the explicit and implicit rules of
the Linux kernel community. They can also build a kernel, install it, write kernel patches and test them. They know how to send
patches and who to send them to, as well as how to re-work patches by incorporating feedback from reviewers.
