Hi, I am Stefan Römer.

{{< image src="/img/avatar.png" alt="Stefan Römer" position="center" style="border-style: solid; bolder-size: 8px; border-color: grey; border-radius: 50%;" >}}

I am a Software Engineer with 15+ years of working experience (mainly C/C++, shell and batch
scripts, python) and in-depth OS (Windows and Linux) and networking knowledge (implementation of
custom interfaces, amongst others a CORBA interface used in the sorting centers of an international
logistics company).

I studied Information and Communications Technologies (ICT) at the Frankfurt University of Applied Sciences
from which I graduated with the degree of a Dipl.&#x2011;Ing.(FH) [Graduate Engineer (University of Applied Sciences)]
in 2006. Since 2007 I did work as a development engineer in the field of industrial and logistics automation.
In 2019 I moved to Vietnam, started my own business and do provide software development services on a free
lance basis.

Initially I got interested in computers when my father bought a 286AT running MS DOS 3.3 a long time ago.
With the time I used different Windows versions (from Windows 3.1 to the current versions) but since I
got my hands on a bundle of SuSE Linux 5.1 at the local book store I am a Linux fan and Windows didn't
touch my own PCs since many years. Currently my PCs run Gentoo and Artix Linux.

I am developing mainly with C/C++ and bash scripts. Sometimes I use Python as well and recently I got started
using Rust as a modern programming language which enforces memory safety and prevents concurrent data races at
compile time. I also got interested in cyber security and started gaining knowledge on the
[TryHackMe](https://www.tryhackme.com) platform. Here my TryHackMe badge: {{< thm_badge >}}

I fell in love with Vietnam so I live and work here. I also like photography, badminton and strong vietnamese coffee - lots of it.

# Describing myself with some Q&A

   No question about that: Linux!

   No Java! C/C++ (or Rust) and Python/Bash where viable.

   Vim - Neovim to be specific.

 - CLI or GUI?  
   CLI wherever viable. GUI everywhere else.

   Some HTML and CSS is OK. I don't do more than that!

   BAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHH! (see 'Databases' above)

#### Other stuff:

   Vietnamese people are early birds, they get up when I go to bed. I'm a night owl!
