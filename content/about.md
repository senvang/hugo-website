Hi, I am Stefan Römer.

{{< image src="/img/avatar.png" alt="Stefan Römer" position="center" style="border-style: solid; bolder-size: 8px; border-color: grey; border-radius: 50%;" >}}

I am a freelance software developer with over 17+ years of [experience](#experience) (details below) with the main focus
on low-level, system and network programming. From server to embedded - I like it simple and minimalistic and prefer a good
command line interface over GUIs where feasible. I am also interested in system administration and task automation.

Linux is my OS of choice (since ~1998 when I got my hands on a SuSE Linux bundle in a local book store). Currently I use
Gentoo Linux on my server and my desktops and OpenWRT on a bunch of network devices in the house. I have experience with
Debian and RedHat based distributions as well and did work with Windows too.

As a generalist and avid learner I am always curious and interested in new things and like digging deeper to understand
how things work (or why they don't) and therefore I gathered a wide range of knowledge and interests which only partially
can be highlighted here.
