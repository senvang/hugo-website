Hi, I am Stefan Römer.

{{< image src="/img/avatar.png" alt="Stefan Römer" position="center" style="border-style: solid; bolder-size: 8px; border-color: grey; border-radius: 50%;" >}}

I am a [self-employed](/business) Software Engineer with over 16 years of [work experience](/experience) (mainly C/C++, shell and batch
scripts, python) and in-depth OS (Windows and Linux) and networking knowledge (implementation of
custom interfaces, amongst others a CORBA interface used in the sorting centers of an international
logistics company).

I studied Information and Communications Technologies (ICT) at the Frankfurt University of Applied Sciences
from which I graduated with the degree of a Dipl.&#x2011;Ing.(FH) [Graduate Engineer (University of Applied Sciences)]
in 2006. Since 2007 I did work as a development engineer in the field of logistics automation.
In 2019 I moved to Vietnam, started my own business and do provide software development services on a free
lance basis.

I am a Linux user and Windows didn't touch my PCs since many years (currently running Gentoo and Artix Linux).
I like minimalistic (e.g. embedded) systems and dealing with low-level stuff. I feel at home in a terminal and prefer
a good command line interface over GUIs where feasible.

I also like tinkering (with Arduino, ESP32, Raspberry Pi etc.), 3D printing, badminton and I NEED coffee.
